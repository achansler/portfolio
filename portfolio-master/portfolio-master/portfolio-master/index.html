                <p>Here we can talk about what we needed, and why we needed it quickly. Let’s also talk about why a true google design sprint wouldn’t work for the team, so I came up with a shortened design sprint that would fit our needs but allow us all to work quickly and still gain the valuable insights that a true design sprint allows. Shared this schedule with the team via a google doc that outlined what we’ll have at the end of the day, which allowed for stakeholder and team buy-in.</p>

                <p>Day 1 is all about understanding the problem that we’re trying to solve. Abigail will review product requirements and MVP restrictions, what users are involved, the user flows, look back to research and usability testing that was conducted with FE2 score reports, and current feedback on FE1 scores from partners. The end of the day goal was to have a defined problem to solve, and a list of questions that we wanted to answer by the end of the sprint. Mention here that this was all remote, so we relied heavily on Google Docs and async work.</p>
                <p>The first team exercise that we did was to write down How Might We questions. After reviewing the previous research that had been done (partner feedback, blah blah blah, etc. more stuff goes here) . We came up with a long list of questions and then organized them into themes. After we organized them, we picked a few questions that we wanted to focus on for this sprint. </p>

            <p>The original purpose of day 2 was meant to be a sketch workshop, but because the remote nature of our team, we couldn’t find a time that worked for everyone and allowed them to get their own work done, so I decided to change day 2 to be a day where everyone can focus on collecting their examples, with the idea that we could lean on the examples heavily during our sketch workshop on day 3.
  </p>
  <p>The team collected examples, and by the end of the day I had complied them into a Google Slide presentation so we could all work within the same document during our Zoom meeting the next day. </p>
