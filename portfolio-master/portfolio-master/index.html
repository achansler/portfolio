                  <p>Here we can talk about what we needed, and why we needed it quickly. Let’s also talk about why a true google design sprint wouldn’t work for the team, so I came up with a shortened design sprint that would fit our needs but allow us all to work quickly and still gain the valuable insights that a true design sprint allows. Shared this schedule with the team via a google doc that outlined what we’ll have at the end of the day, which allowed for stakeholder and team buy-in.</p>

                  <p>Day 1 is all about understanding the problem that we’re trying to solve. Abigail will review product requirements and MVP restrictions, what users are involved, the user flows, look back to research and usability testing that was conducted with FE2 score reports, and current feedback on FE1 scores from partners. The end of the day goal was to have a defined problem to solve, and a list of questions that we wanted to answer by the end of the sprint. Mention here that this was all remote, so we relied heavily on Google Docs and async work.</p>
                  <p>The first team exercise that we did was to write down How Might We questions. After reviewing the previous research that had been done (partner feedback, blah blah blah, etc. more stuff goes here) . We came up with a long list of questions and then organized them into themes. After we organized them, we picked a few questions that we wanted to focus on for this sprint. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The team collected examples, and by the end of the day I had complied them into a Google Slide presentation so we could all work within the same document during our Zoom meeting the next day. </p>

          <p>The Bloomingdale’s brick and mortar stores are a constant source of confusion for both customers and store associates. For customers, the sheer size of the stores can be intimidating, and searching for a specific brand in a sea clothing can be extremely time consuming. Store associates are constantly asked the same logistical questions, which distracts them from helping customers shop and purchase items. Because of these issues, Bloomingdale's requested that we design a Store Guide for the app that would alleviate some of the customer in-store pain points, and that could be built upon with future iterations.</p>

          <p>With 47% of Americans setting a New Years resolution annually, and only 8% following through with their goals, it’s obvious that something is missing. With all of the goal keeping apps out there, it’s clear that tracking your goal isn't the problem. As we dove deeper, we found that people who are embedded in social groups that are encouraging and supportive actually stick to their goals, and make positive changes. With this information in mind, we created Bamboo, an iOS chat app that pairs people together, so that they can help one another achieve their goals.</p>

            <h6 class = "sectionHeading">Wireframes</h6>
            <p>Because not only setting out to achieve your goal, but helping someone else along the way can be intimidating, I design Bamboo’s user journey to be purposefully simple and familiar. When the user signs up for the first time, they are introduced to BamBot, a bot that walks them through the sign up process through a chat, familiarizing the user with this format. BamBot is an important part of Bamboo, as he introduces the user to their buddy, and also checks up on the user throughout their time using the app, prompting interactions with their buddy.</p>

            <p>Starting on a lofty goal can be scary, so I designed Bamboo to feel fun and friendly. For the logo and icon, I wanted Bamboo to stand out in a sea of other messaging apps, who’s ubiquitous chat icons made the individual apps feel like one in the same, but to also make the user know that Bamboo is a messaging app. To achieve this, I combined the shapes of a chat bubble and a leaf. I also created a friendly panda mascot, who is used to describe Bamboo’s process and the most popular goals, working out more, eating healthier, and saving money.</p>
