              <p>Credentials is an assessment tool where individuals can take assessments in web development, digital marketing, or data science and analytics to show their true skills in those fields. The assessments are most commonly used as part of a company's hiring process or in company wide employee training training.</span></p>
              <p>Usage of our Front End Web Development Level 1 assessment, which tests skills in HTML and CSS, was increased drastically and we needed to build a way to allow test takers to view their score, and understand why they received that grade.
                Because we needed a solution quickly, I proposed that we try a Design Sprint. The whole team couldn’t take a week off of their work to help so I came up with a shortened version that fit our needs. The Sprint consisted of 5 day, each day being dedicated to a different part of the process.

              <p>Day 1 was dedicated to understanding the problem that we set out to solve. After reviewing product requirements, I reviewed research, user interviews, and usability testing notes from a similar feature that we had previously built. Armed with this information, I was able to define the users that would interact with this new feature, and create simple user flows that the team could use as a jumping off point when we all got together. </p>
              <p>After working through a “How Might We” exercise, I came away with a defined problem to solve, that we referred back to multiple times during the 5 day sprint. I also recorded a list of questions that we hoped to answer after usability testing on day 5, which we added to along the week.</p>

          <p>The Bloomingdale’s brick and mortar stores are a constant source of confusion for both customers and store associates. For customers, the sheer size of the stores can be intimidating, and searching for a specific brand in a sea clothing can be extremely time consuming. Store associates are constantly asked the same logistical questions, which distracts them from helping customers shop and purchase items. Because of these issues, Bloomingdale's requested that we design a Store Guide for the app that would alleviate some of the customer in-store pain points, and that could be built upon with future iterations.</p>

          <p>The actual Store Guide page answers the questions that customers ask associates most frequently in the store. Customers would often ask about specific products, but could rarely find an associate to help them, so we surfaced that "scan an item" feature, which was previously hidden in the search bar on the homepage of the app. This allows the user to get more product information, such as size and color availability on their own.</p>

          <p>Finding store details, and exactly what that designers a store sold, was a huge problem for customers that prefer to shop in store rather than online. We implemented a find a store page that can be accessed outside of the stores, and would save the store that was visited the most frequently under “My Preferred Store”. Within the store details, the user can view the Store Directory, which would show the user the brands that are sold in a particular store.</p>

          <p>The idea of personalization at Bloomingdale’s is growing, so we wanted to let our app users know about things that are relevant to them, such as specific sales and events. The demand for the “Buy Online, Pickup in Store” feature is also increasing, but as is the confusion around where exactly to pick up the items as each store is different. To give individual users exactly the information they need that's personal to them,we designed a notification center that can be accessed on the homepage of the app.</p>

            <p>With 47% of Americans setting a New Years resolution annually, and only 8% following through with their goals, it’s obvious that something is missing. With all of the goal keeping apps out there, it’s clear that tracking your goal isn't the problem. As we dove deeper, we found that people who are embedded in social groups that are encouraging and supportive actually stick to their goals, and make positive changes. With this information in mind, we created Bamboo, an iOS chat app that pairs people together, so that they can help one another achieve their goals.</p>

              <p>Because not only setting out to achieve your goal, but helping someone else along the way can be intimidating, I design Bamboo’s user journey to be purposefully simple and familiar. When the user signs up for the first time, they are introduced to BamBot, a bot that walks them through the sign up process through a chat, familiarizing the user with this format. BamBot is an important part of Bamboo, as he introduces the user to their buddy, and also checks up on the user throughout their time using the app, prompting interactions with their buddy.</p>

              <p>Starting on a lofty goal can be scary, so I designed Bamboo to feel fun and friendly. For the logo and icon, I wanted Bamboo to stand out in a sea of other messaging apps, who’s ubiquitous chat icons made the individual apps feel like one in the same, but to also make the user know that Bamboo is a messaging app. To achieve this, I combined the shapes of a chat bubble and a leaf. I also created a friendly panda mascot, who is used to describe Bamboo’s process and the most popular goals, working out more, eating healthier, and saving money.</p>
